# Lazyweb Design Research

Structured design research that identifies competitors, gathers real app screenshots,
and produces a report with embedded visual references.

## CRITICAL: Output Behavior

**This skill produces FILES, not a plan.** Regardless of whether you are in plan mode
or not, ALWAYS:

1. Write the HTML report to `.lazyweb/design-research/{topic}-{date}/report.html`
2. Embed Lazyweb references directly with their returned `imageUrl`/`image_url`; save only current-state and web-captured screenshots under `.lazyweb/design-research/{topic}-{date}/references/`
3. Do NOT create `report.md` or any other Markdown report artifact
4. Do NOT write research content into a plan file
5. After saving, show the user a summary of findings and tell them where the files are
6. Ask the user if the research looks good
7. If in plan mode, exit plan mode after the user confirms — the research is done
8. Suggest next steps: "You can now use this research to inform your implementation,
   ask `/lazyweb` to improve your current design, or start building."

## When to Use This

- User wants to understand a design space before building
- User needs competitive analysis for a feature
- User asks "what are best practices for X"
- User wants to see how the best apps solve a specific problem

## When NOT to Use This

- User just wants to see a few screenshots quickly -> route to `lazyweb-quick-references`
- User has an existing design and wants improvement ideas -> route to `lazyweb-design-improve`
- User wants creative/unconventional ideas -> route to `lazyweb-design-brainstorm`

## Lazyweb MCP Setup

Use the hosted Lazyweb MCP tools at `https://www.lazyweb.com/mcp` for all Lazyweb database access.

Required MCP tools:
- `lazyweb_search` — text search over mobile and desktop screenshots
- `lazyweb_find_similar` — more results like a returned Lazyweb `imageUrl` or image payload
- `lazyweb_compare_image` — visual search from `image_base64` + `mime_type` or `image_url`
- `lazyweb_health` — connectivity check

These are the current public gateway names. Backend/internal surfaces may also
expose canonical tools such as `search_screenshots`, `list_filters`,
`vision_screenshots`, and `metadata_screenshots`; prefer the `lazyweb_*` names
in this skill. Use `high_design_bar: true` only when the live tool schema exposes
it and the user asks for high-design-bar companies, premium examples,
best-designed apps, or stronger visual-quality filtering. That filter is backed
by `companies.high_design_bar = true`.

Before searching, verify MCP is available by listing tools and running
`lazyweb_health`.

**If Lazyweb MCP is not installed or auth fails:**
Tell the user: "Lazyweb MCP is not installed. Run `curl -fsSL https://www.lazyweb.com/install.sh | bash`, reload this client, then rerun this skill. Lazyweb is free; the bearer token is
only for no-billing UI reference tools and is okay in ignored local config."
Then proceed with web research only — the skill still works, just without Lazyweb's database.

## Browse Setup (run BEFORE any web capture)

```bash
LB=""
# Check the standalone Lazyweb checkout first
for _P in "$(pwd)/.lazyweb/repos/lazyweb-skill/browse/dist/browse" ~/.lazyweb/repos/lazyweb-skill/browse/dist/browse; do
  [ -x "$_P" ] && LB="$_P" && break
done
# Fall back to gstack browse
if [ -z "$LB" ]; then
  _ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
  [ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse" ] && LB="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse"
  [ -z "$LB" ] && [ -x ~/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse ] && LB=~/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse
fi
[ -x "$LB" ] && echo "BROWSE_READY: $LB" || echo "NO_BROWSE"
```

If `NO_BROWSE`: Web screenshot capture is unavailable. Lazyweb results still work —
just describe web examples in text without screenshots. To enable web captures,
run: `cd ~/.lazyweb/repos/lazyweb-skill/browse && ./setup`

## Workflow

### 0. Ground the search (run first)

Before searching, ground the work in what the user is building, and avoid guessing when a wrong guess wastes a search:

1. **Detect context.** Run `lazyweb-context-detect` (on `PATH` when installed by setup; otherwise `~/.lazyweb/repos/lazyweb-skill/bin/lazyweb-context-detect`). It prints the project, platform (mobile/desktop), and stack. Use it to bias the `platform` filter and to caption references accurately.
2. **Clarify only what's missing.** If it reports `platform=unknown`, or the product/screen is unclear from the request, ask ONE AskUserQuestion to pin down product/screen, mobile vs desktop, and the specific outcome. Skip anything the context already answered.

### 1. Understand the Research Question

Before searching, clarify:
- What specific screen, flow, or feature are they researching?
- What's their product? (app type, platform, audience)
- Mobile or desktop/web patterns needed?

### 2. Capture Current State (if applicable)

If the user is researching a specific page or app they're building (not a general topic),
capture the current state:

- **Running dev server or URL available:** Use preview/browse tools to screenshot it
- **Mobile app:** Ask user to provide a screenshot
- **No specific page:** Skip this step

Save as `$REPORT_DIR/references/current-state.png` and include it in the HTML report
after the TL;DR using this structure:

```html
<section>
  <h2>Current State</h2>
  <figure>
    <img src="references/current-state.png" alt="Current State">
    <figcaption>{Brief description of what we're looking at}</figcaption>
  </figure>
</section>
```

This grounds the entire report — the reader sees where we are before seeing where we could go.

### 3. Identify Competitors and Adjacent Companies

Think about two groups:
- **Direct competitors** — apps that solve the same problem
- **Adjacent companies with great design** — apps in related spaces known for excellent UX (e.g., researching a fintech app? Look at Stripe, Linear, Notion for general design quality)

### 4. Search Lazyweb

Call `lazyweb_search` multiple times with different angles:

```json
{"query":"<specific screen/component>","limit":30}
{"query":"<screen type>","company":"<competitor>","limit":30}
{"query":"<screen type>","category":"<category>","limit":30}
{"query":"<screen type>","platform":"desktop","limit":30}
{"query":"<screen type>","platform":"mobile","limit":30}
{"query":"<different description of same thing>","limit":30}
{"query":"<even more specific variant>","limit":30}
```

If the live schema exposes `high_design_bar`, add it to one search when the user
asks for high-design-bar, premium, or best-designed examples.

**Platform routing:** Lazyweb has both mobile app screenshots and desktop/web site screenshots.
- `--platform mobile` — mobile app screenshots only
- `--platform desktop` — desktop/web site screenshots only
- `--platform all` (default) — search both, results grouped desktop-first then mobile
- A mac app, SaaS dashboard, or web product → use `--platform desktop`
- An iPhone/Android app → use `--platform mobile`
- General research or cross-platform → omit (searches both)

Each result includes a `platform` field ("mobile" or "desktop") so you know the source.
Desktop results also include a `pageUrl` field with the original site URL.

**Assess quality:** `matchCount` 2/3 or 3/3 = strong. 1/3 = weak. `similarity` > 0.4 = good.

**Explore generously.** Run 3-5 searches minimum with different query angles. Cast a wide
net — you can filter later. Don't stop at the first search.

**HIGH BAR FOR REFERENCES:** Each Lazyweb result includes a `visionDescription` field —
a text description of what's actually in the screenshot. Read it.

**Rules for attaching references to the report:**
1. Read `visionDescription` before using ANY screenshot
2. The screenshot MUST directly illustrate the point you're making
3. If `visionDescription` doesn't match your suggestion — DO NOT USE IT
4. A report with 3 perfectly-matched references beats 10 loosely-related ones
5. Better to have NO image than a mismatched one — describe the idea in text instead
6. Never guess what's in a screenshot. If there's no visionDescription, skip it.
7. Use `visionDescription` to write accurate captions — don't invent descriptions

Mismatched references destroy user trust faster than anything else.

### 5. Search Connected Inspiration Libraries

Check if `~/.lazyweb/libraries.json` exists and has connected libraries:

```bash
cat ~/.lazyweb/libraries.json 2>/dev/null
```

If libraries are configured, search each one using the browse tool. For each library:

1. Navigate to the library's search URL: `$LB goto "{searchUrl}"`
2. Take a snapshot to understand the page: `$LB snapshot -i`
3. Find the search input and type the research query: `$LB fill @eN "{query}"`
4. Submit and wait for results: `$LB press Enter` then `$LB snapshot -i`
5. Browse through results — click into the most relevant ones
6. Screenshot the best results: `$LB screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/references/{library}-{company}-{screen}.png"`
7. Note what's in each screenshot for accurate captions

**Quality bar**: Same as Lazyweb — only use screenshots that directly illustrate a point
in the report. A mismatched reference from Mobbin is just as bad as a mismatched one
from Lazyweb.

**If the library session has expired** (login wall, redirect to sign-in):
- Tell the user: "Your {library} session has expired. Reconnect that inspiration source manually before relying on it."
- Skip this library and continue with the rest — don't block the research.

Label all library-sourced references in the report with the library name: `[Mobbin]`, `[Savee]`, etc.

### 6. Web Research + Live Screenshot Capture (REQUIRED)

Lazyweb covers both mobile and desktop, but most research also needs recent trends,
expert analysis, and live examples from competitors. **Always do web research alongside
Lazyweb**, even when Lazyweb results are good.

**Step A — Find interesting URLs via WebSearch:**
- Search for "[topic] UX best practices [current year]"
- Search for "[topic] design patterns analysis"
- Search for "[competitor name] [screen type]"
- Search for "best [screen type] examples"

Collect 3-8 interesting URLs from the search results.

**Step B — Capture live screenshots from those URLs:**
For each interesting URL found in step A, visit the page and screenshot it.
Save directly to the report's references folder.

```bash
if [ -x "$LB" ]; then
  $LB goto "https://example.com/pricing"
  $LB screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/references/example-pricing-page.png"
fi
```

If the browse tool is not available, use `curl` to download any publicly accessible
screenshot URLs you find, or describe the page in the report without an image.

**This is not optional.** The report should have a MIX of Lazyweb database screenshots
AND live web captures. Lazyweb gives you curated, clean screenshots. Web captures give
you the latest, most current state of competitor sites.

**Platform balance rule:** Use `--platform desktop` or `--platform mobile` to match the
user's target platform. Aim for at least 50% same-platform references.

### 7. Download References

Determine the absolute path for this report's directory:
```bash
REPORT_DIR="$(pwd)/.lazyweb/design-research/{topic-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}"
mkdir -p "$REPORT_DIR/references"
```

Do not download Lazyweb database images. Use the `imageUrl`/`image_url` returned by Lazyweb
directly in the HTML report. Supabase storage-backed image URLs are signed for
90 days and intended for report embedding; if a selected Lazyweb result has no returned image URL, omit the
image and rely on `visionDescription` plus text.

For web-captured examples (from step 5B):
```bash
if [ -x "$LB" ]; then
  $LB goto "https://example.com"
  $LB screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/references/{company}-{screen-slug}.png"
fi
```

Cap at 30 visual references total. Name locally captured files descriptively:
`stripe-pricing-page.png`, `linear-onboarding-step1.png`.

Label each reference with its source in the report: `[Lazyweb]` or `[Web]` so the
user knows the provenance.

### 8. Write the HTML Report

Write directly to `.lazyweb/design-research/{topic-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}/report.html`.
Do not create a Markdown version.

**Reverse pyramid structure:** Lead with action, back into analysis. The reader should
get the answer in the first 30 seconds, then optionally dive deeper.

**Skip sections that don't apply.** A narrow question doesn't need all sections. Only include sections where you have real findings.

**Reference presentation contract:** Do not stack every reference as full-width
figures down the page. Key examples and recommendation evidence should use a
`.deck` snap-carousel that lays every reference out at a glance (scroll-snaps with ◀ ▶ prev/next buttons) while keeping the recommendation in view. Each
slide/card must include:
- Company/product name, source label (`[Lazyweb]`, `[Web]`, `[Mobbin]`, etc.),
  and URL when available
- A one-line "why this is here" caption tying the reference to the specific
  recommendation, pattern, anti-pattern, or insight
- The key visual detail to borrow, adapt, or avoid

For desktop/web landing-page screenshots, never render long full-page captures at
natural height. Show them in a desktop viewport frame instead: use a 16:10 or
1440x900-style crop with `overflow: hidden`, `object-fit: cover`, and
`object-position: top`. Make that above-the-fold crop large and legible enough to understand on its own — do NOT add "open full image/page" links or any click-to-view.
For live web captures, prefer viewport screenshots over full-page screenshots.
Mobile/portrait screenshots must be shown WHOLE (object-fit: contain, no cropping), at a size large enough to read; cap height only to keep one shot from dominating.

Use this content outline, rendered as semantic HTML:

```text
# Design Research: {Topic}

## Agent Instructions
{Report section #1. Emit the copy-pastable downstream-agent handoff exactly as defined in "Report essentials" below — one human sentence, then the AGENT HANDOFF block summarizing the top recommendations, what to index on vs not, and how to dive further.}

## Current State
{Include ONLY if a current state screenshot was captured in step 2. Otherwise omit this section.}
![Current State](references/current-state.png)
*{Brief description of what we're looking at}*

## Recommendations / Next Steps
{What to implement, in priority order. Each recommendation tied to evidence below.
This is the ACTION section — specific, implementable guidance.}

1. **{Recommendation}** — {Why, with reference to evidence}
2. **{Recommendation}** — {Why}
3. **{Recommendation}** — {Why}

**Mockups:** For each recommendation, show the proposed layout with a generated image (if an image tool is available) or an HTML/CSS mock-frame — never ASCII art. See "Report essentials → C. Mockups" below.

## Key Examples
{The visual centerpiece. Use a `.deck` snap-carousel (every reference visible at a glance, scroll-snaps with ◀ ▶ prev/next buttons), not a long vertical gallery. Mix Lazyweb and web-captured screenshots. Label each
source. Each slide includes company, URL/source, why it is included, and the
specific visual detail that supports the recommendation.}

.deck grid (one figure per reference, all visible — scroll-snaps with ◀ ▶ prev/next buttons):
- Stripe [Web] - why this supports the recommendation; key detail to borrow
- Linear [Lazyweb] - why this supports the recommendation; key detail to borrow

## Patterns
{Render as `.pat` cards with a `.deck` snap-carousel (see "Operating principles & evidence components"): each pattern = name + verdict `.tag` + `.prev` count ("seen in N of M references") + one-line table-stakes claim + a `.deck` snap-carousel of 2-4 real screenshots that exhibit it (caption = company + the exact UI detail from visionDescription). Show the shared pattern; do not just list brand names.}

## Anti-Patterns
{Render as `.pat` cards with `.tag.avoid` and an "avoid" `.deck`: each anti-pattern embeds the real screenshot of the bad pattern + a one-line "what not to copy". Never name a company as anti-pattern evidence unless its screenshot is shown; if none exists in-corpus, label it "no reference captured - directional" (`.ebadge.single`).}

## Unique Angles
{Each standout MUST embed the specific cropped screenshot of that exact detail (a framed shot or one-card `.deck`), caption pointing at the precise element that is the X100 detail. The most "you have to see it" section cannot be prose-only.}

## Findings
{Inside a collapsed `<details><summary>How we got here</summary>`, include an EVIDENCE TABLE: one row per reference with company | source | matchCount | similarity | which rec/pattern it supports — so "clustered at matchCount 2-3 / similarity ~0.4-0.6" is shown data, not a sentence.}

## Sources
{Compact list. Lazyweb screenshots are cited inline above.
Web sources listed here with URLs.}
```

### 9. Report essentials (apply to the report you write)

Three rules keep every Lazyweb report consistent. Follow them exactly.

#### A. Agent Instructions — report section #1

The report opens with an **Agent Instructions** callout: one plain human sentence, then a copy-pastable block written FOR A DOWNSTREAM CODING AGENT (not the human reader). Emit exactly this structure:

```html
<section id="agent-instructions" class="agent-instructions">
  <div class="ai-head"><span class="ai-badge">FOR THE CODING AGENT</span>
    <button class="ai-copy" type="button" onclick="
      var sec=this.closest('.agent-instructions'); var txt=sec.querySelector('.ai-block').innerText;
      var done=function(ok){this.textContent=ok?'Copied':'Press Cmd/Ctrl+C';setTimeout(function(){this.textContent='Copy';}.bind(this),1500);}.bind(this);
      if(navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText){navigator.clipboard.writeText(txt).then(function(){done(true);},function(){done(false);});}
      else{var r=document.createRange();r.selectNodeContents(sec.querySelector('.ai-block'));var s=getSelection();s.removeAllRanges();s.addRange(r);try{document.execCommand('copy');done(true);}catch(e){done(false);}}">Copy</button>
  </div>
  <p class="ai-human">{one human sentence: the single most important thing to do}</p>
  <pre class="ai-block">{COPY BLOCK — fill the braces from this report}</pre>
</section>
```

Copy-block text (keep these exact labels; fill `{REPORT_PATH}` with the absolute path of the report.html you wrote):

```
LAZYWEB REPORT — AGENT HANDOFF
Use the report at {REPORT_PATH} as a starting point for {TASK}.

TOP RECOMMENDATIONS (do first):
1. {rec 1, one imperative line}
2. {rec 2}
3. {rec 3}

INDEX ON: {1-3 well-evidenced signals/patterns from this report}
DO NOT OVER-INDEX ON: {weak-evidence / single-source / aesthetic-only / non-transferable items}
DIVE FURTHER: {next Lazyweb skill or MCP tool} — {why}

Evidence basis: {Lazyweb screenshots | web captures} · {DATE}
```

For THIS skill, `{TASK}` = "implementing {topic} using competitor-validated design patterns", and `DIVE FURTHER` → "`/lazyweb-design-improve` to pressure-test your build against these references, or `lazyweb_find_similar` to widen a specific pattern".

#### B. Conciseness & "show, don't tell"

Write the report to be skimmed — no length target, let the evidence set the length:
- **Lead with value** — Agent Instructions and the top recommendation come first; the reader sees what to do before any analysis.
- **Show, don't tell** — make the case with VISUAL evidence (embedded real-app screenshots via Lazyweb `imageUrl`, and where relevant a mock-frame), not paragraphs. A screenshot that proves the point beats three sentences describing it.
- **Index the "why" on evidence, not adjectives** — each recommendation points to a specific visual reference, never generic design-speak.
- Cut throat-clearing and restatement; use tables/bullets where they read faster.

#### C. Mockups — never ASCII art

To show a proposed layout: if an image-generation tool is available to you, generate a mockup asset, save it to `references/mock-{slug}.png`, and embed it with a caption. Otherwise render an HTML/CSS **mock-frame** (a styled `<div>` wireframe). Never use ASCII/box-drawing art. Mobile mock-frame for app screens, desktop for web/SaaS; adapt the labeled boxes to the recommendation.

```html
<figure class="mock mobile"><div class="frame"><div class="notch"></div><div class="body">
  <div class="box">Header / value prop</div>
  <div class="row"><div class="box">Plan A</div><div class="box">Plan B</div></div>
  <div class="box tall">Benefits / hero</div><div class="box cta">Primary CTA</div>
</div></div><figcaption class="cap">Mock-frame — {what this proposes}</figcaption></figure>

<figure class="mock desktop"><div class="frame"><div class="bar"><span class="dot"></span><span class="dot"></span><span class="dot"></span><span class="url">example.com</span></div><div class="body">
  <div class="row"><div class="box">Logo</div><div class="box">Nav</div><div class="box">Sign in</div></div>
  <div class="row"><div class="box">Feature</div><div class="box">Feature</div><div class="box">Feature</div></div>
  <div class="box cta">Primary CTA</div>
</div></div><figcaption class="cap">Mock-frame — {what this proposes}</figcaption></figure>
```

#### D. Shared CSS (include in the report `<style>`)

```css
:root{--ink:#1f2328;--mut:#57606a;--line:#d0d7de;--soft:#eef4fb;--accent:#0969da}
.agent-instructions{background:var(--soft);border-left:4px solid var(--accent);border-radius:8px;padding:14px 16px;margin:18px 0}

.mock .cap{font-size:12px;color:var(--mut);margin-top:6px;text-align:center}
```

### 10. HTML Requirements

The `report.html` file should:
- Be a single HTML file with inline CSS (no external CSS/JS dependencies; one small inline `onclick` copy handler is allowed for the Agent Instructions block)
- Include the Report essentials shared CSS (section 9.D) in `<style>`; use clean, readable styling: system fonts, max-width 900px, comfortable line-height
- Use absolute Lazyweb `imageUrl`/`image_url` values for Lazyweb references
- Use relative paths (`references/filename.png`) only for current-state and web-captured screenshots saved locally
- Use `.deck` snap-carousels (every reference visible, scroll-snaps with ◀ ▶ prev/next buttons) instead of long vertical image stacks
- Crop desktop/web landing-page screenshots into a fixed desktop viewport frame; do not show very long page captures at full height in the report body
- Style images with rounded corners, subtle shadow, max-width that fits the layout, and height constraints that prevent zoomed-in or oversized visuals
- Make the Agent Instructions block (section 9.A) the FIRST section, styled as the light-blue callout
- Include proper semantic HTML (h1, h2, h3, p, ul, ol, table)
- Make tables clean with light borders and header background
- Open the HTML file in the user's browser: `open "$REPORT_DIR/report.html"`

Tell the user where the report was saved. Mention they may want to add `.lazyweb/` to `.gitignore`.

## Quality Calibration

- Lazyweb screenshots are evidence — you can see what a real app looks like
- Web articles are opinions — filter for quality
- Your synthesis is interpretation — label it as such
- Don't over-index on weak Lazyweb results (matchCount 1/3, similarity < 0.3)
- When the corpus is weak for a topic, say so. Don't pad with irrelevant results.
- A report with 5 strong references beats 20 weak ones


## Operating principles & evidence components (REQUIRED - overrides convenience)

## Operating principles (apply to every report you write)

These four rules override convenience. A report that breaks them is non-conforming, even if every section is present.

**1. Show, don't tell — every claim carries its proof.**
Any assertion — a pattern, anti-pattern, idea, hypothesis, "what's working" item, convention check, recommendation, or A/B learning — must render the real screenshot(s) or experiment that demonstrate it, *beside the claim*, never a scroll away. When more than one reference backs a claim, render them as a **`.deck` snap-carousel** — a horizontally-scrolling strip that snaps card-to-card with ◀ ▶ prev/next buttons — so the reader can step through the proof, never hidden behind a prose list or a "see Section 5" pointer. Prevalence words ("most", "near-universal", "dominant") must be backed by a shown count ("5 of 9 references"), never an adjective alone.

**2. Be opinionated; carry the decision.**
Lead with ONE ranked recommended path, marked as the lead pick (`.lead` ribbon) in the *human-visible body* — not only in the agent copy block. Tag every other option Do / Explore / Skip (or P0/P1/P2) with a one-line "skip if". No ties among top picks; no flat undifferentiated menu. The "Skip" rows must link to the evidence (e.g. the anti-pattern screenshot) so the skip decision is shown, not just asserted.

**3. Maximize confidence with evidence + data.**
Back each recommendation with what worked for OTHER apps (real screenshots) PLUS supporting data: a prevalence count across the corpus ("seen in N of M examples") and, where the screen is growth/monetization, A/B experiment evidence via `lazyweb_ab_test_research`. If no experiment data exists, say so explicitly ("no experiment data found — recommendation is design-prevalence-based") and substitute the prevalence count as the directional signal. Never let a recommendation render with neither a visual nor a number behind it.

**4. Be truth-seeking — never overclaim.**
Label evidence strength honestly with an `.ebadge` on every claim/card/rec: **Measured** (real lift number) vs **Directional** (screenshot-diff / visual prevalence, no lift) vs **Single-source / Off-category**. Forbid comparative-performance verbs ("outperforms", "underperforms") unless a measurement backs them. Put a one-line corpus-strength banner (`.corpus`) right after Agent Instructions when evidence is single-source, thin, or context-mismatched. Tag any reference whose brand was inferred from a URL/vision-description ("brand inferred — verify"). Show absence claims with evidence-of-search (queries run × screens reviewed + the closest near-miss). Never invent a reference, a metric, or a company name. **Never use ASCII/box-drawing `<pre>` art for a layout — render the `.mock` mock-frame or a generated image.**

### Evidence components (render claims with these — never prose alone)

Put the CSS below in the report `<style>` and adapt the markup per claim. Reuse the existing tokens (`--ink:#1f2328; --mut:#57606a; --line:#d0d7de; --soft:#eef4fb; --accent:#0969da`).

- **Patterns, Anti-Patterns (use `.tag.avoid`), Unique Angles, "What's working", Convention-check Missing/Unusual cells, hypothesis "supporting evidence", brainstorm "Applied here"** -> render as `.pat` cards: name + verdict `.tag` + `.prev` count ("seen in N of M references") + one-line claim + a `.deck` snap-carousel of 2-4 real screenshots that exhibit it (caption = company + the exact UI detail from `visionDescription`). The proof sits WITH the claim, never a scroll away. Show the pattern; don't just list brand names.
- **The decision section** (design-research "What to build first", quick-references "Recommended path", brainstorm "Which ideas to prototype", design-improve idea order, ab-test "Recommendations", paywall "Prioritization") -> render a **Decision legend** (`.legend`, one `.legend-row` per rec in rank order — the whole ranking graspable in one glance) ABOVE a `.recs` stack of **recommendation cards** (`.rec`; the #1 card is `.rec.lead` with the START-HERE hero + browser-chrome frame). Each card carries a BIG inline-legible proof (desktop 16:10 above-the-fold crop / mobile whole-screen via `.recs.mobileset`) — never a tiny click-into thumbnail — plus a `.verdict` (Do/Explore/Skip), an `.ebadge` evidence label, a prevalence count, and a labeled `.skiprow`. NO table; exactly one lead; no ties.
- **Honesty** -> put a `.corpus` banner right after Agent Instructions (basis / breadth / count / confidence); put an `.ebadge` (Measured | Directional | Single-source-or-off-category) on every claim, card, and recommendation. Never echo a raw "high"; never use "outperforms/underperforms" without a measured lift; tag crawl-seed/URL-inferred brands "brand inferred - verify".
- **Control vs variant (A/B)** -> use the `.flip` two-up grid (stacks on narrow screens; scroll-snaps with ◀ ▶ prev/next buttons); if `vision_description` is empty, synthesize the caption from `what_changed` and tag it "agent-described".

Every embedded screenshot must be FULLY VISIBLE and legible inline — never require a click to view, never a tiny thumbnail-as-proof, never a weird letterboxed ratio. Mobile/portrait shots: show the WHOLE screen (default `.deck` figure, no crop). Desktop/long-scroll pages: tag the figure `.shot-web` to crop to above-the-fold (16:10 from the top) at a size large enough to understand on its own. No "open full image" links. A report that asserts a claim with neither a visual nor a number behind it — or that hides its proof behind a click or a sliver crop — is non-conforming.

<!-- Opinionated ranked pick — Decision legend + recommendation cards (big legible proof; replaces the .ranked table) -->
Emit a `.legend` (one `.legend-row` per rec, in rank order — the whole ranking at a glance) ABOVE a `.recs` stack of `.rec` cards. The #1 card is `class="rec lead"` (START-HERE tab + browser-chrome bar). Desktop proof = 16:10 above-the-fold crop; for a MOBILE/portrait proof wrap the stack in `class="recs mobileset"` and omit `.browserbar`/`.crop-tag` (whole phone screen shown). Proof is a plain `<img>` — legible with JS off; the `⤢ Expand`/zoom is pure enhancement.

### Report footer (REQUIRED — the very last element of the report)

End every report with this footer (add the CSS to `<style>`):

```html
<footer class="lw-foot">Powered by <a href="https://www.lazyweb.com">Lazyweb</a> — turn your agent into a design researcher… for free!</footer>
```

```css
.lw-foot{margin-top:34px;padding-top:14px;border-top:1px solid var(--line);text-align:center;font-size:13px;color:var(--mut)}
```
